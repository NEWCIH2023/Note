# Problem

## [191. Number of 1 Bits](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-1-bits/)


# Solution 

## 1) Bit Manipulation - OPTIMAL

      
      
      
   ### Code : (.cpp)
    
            class Solution {
                public:
                    int hammingWeight(uint32_t n) {
                        int ans = 0;
                        while (n) ans++, n = (n & (n-1));
                        return ans;
                    }
                };
            
 
      Time Complexity  : O(N) 
                         Since the loop runs for 'N' bits
      Space Complexity : O(1)
                         Since no extra space is used.
