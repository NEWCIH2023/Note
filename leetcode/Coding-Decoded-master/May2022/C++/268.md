# Problem

## [268. Missing Number](https://leetcode.com/problems/missing-number/)


# Solution

## 1) Using Sum of Natural numbers Formula - BETTER

      As we know, the sum of first 'n' numbers is n*(n+1)/2.
      Let the sum of the array be 't'.
      The missing number is n*(n+1)/2 - t.
   
      The only disadvantage in this approach is that, it might lead to integer overflow 
      (e.g) 123628*123629 > INT_MAX (2^31 - 1)
      
      That is why, we use the bit manipualation approach.
   
   
      Time Complexity  : O(N)
                         Since we use a single for loop to add all the n-1 numbers.
      Space Complexity : O(1)
                         No extra space is used in this approach.
                         
               
 
## 2) BIT MANIPULATION, XOR - OPTIMAL

      The XOR of same number twice gives zero.
      So, we find xor of all numbers from 1 to n and xor of all elements in the array 
      Since only 1 number is missing, the final XOR values gives the missing element.
      
      (e.g) If array is [1,3,4]
            (1^2^3^4) = 4
            (4^1^2^4) = (1^2) = 3 (Missing Number)
      
     
   ### Code (.cpp)
   
          class Solution {
          public:
              int missingNumber(vector<int>& v) {
                  int x = 0, i, n = v.size();
                  for (i=1;i<=n;i++) x ^= i;
                  for (i=0;i<n;i++) x ^= v[i];
                  return x;
              }
          };
   
      Time Complexity  : O(N)
                         Since we use a single for loop to xor all the 2n-1 numbers.
      Space Complexity : O(1)
                         No extra space is used in this approach.
