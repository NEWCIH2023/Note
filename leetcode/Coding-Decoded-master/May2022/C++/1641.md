# Problem

## [1641. Count Sorted Vowel Strings](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-sorted-vowel-strings/)

 
# Solution  

## 1) DP - Using previously computed values - BETTER

     From the given example, for n = 1 'ans' = 5, for n = 2 'ans' = 15.
     This is because we can add all 5 vowels to the character 'a',
     4 vowels to 'e', 3 to 'i', 2 to 'o', 1 to 'u'.
     Similarly, for n = 3, 1 to 'uu', 2 to 'oo' and 1 to 'ou', and so on.
     
     If we summarize the above logic,
            'a'   'e'   'i'   'o'   'u'
     n = 1   1  +  1  +  1  +  1  +  1
     n = 2   5  +  4  +  3  +  2  +  1
     n = 3   15 +  10 +  6  +  3  +  1
     n = 4   35 +  20 +  10 +  4  +  1
     .
     .
     
     As we can see, the value at 'o' = value of 'o' at n-1 + value of 'o' at n-1.
     Similarly, value at 'a' for n is ('a' + 'e' + 'i' + 'o' + 'u') at n-1.
     
       
   ### Code (.cpp)
   
        class Solution {
        public:
            int countVowelStrings(int n) {
                int i, j, sum = 0;
                vector<int> prefix(5,1);
                if (n == 1) return 5;
                for (i=1;i<n;i++) {
                    sum = 0;
                    for (j=4;j>=0;j--) {
                        sum += prefix[j];
                        prefix[j] = sum;
                    }
                }
                sum = 0;
                for (int b : prefix) sum += b;
                return sum;
            }
        };
     
     
     Time Complexity  : O(N) 
                        Since we traverse from 1 to n
     Space Complexity : O(1)
                        Since we use a vector of size 5 which is constant space
                        
                        
 
## 2) Pentatope number - BETTER

     The answer for the above pattern is the Pentatope number, which is actually the 5th cell
     of any row of Pascal's triangle starting with the 5-term row 1 4 6 4 1, either from left to right or from right to left.
     
     The formula is (n + 4) * (n + 3) * (n + 2) * (n + 1) / 24.
     
       
   ### Code (.cpp)
   
        class Solution {
        public:
            int countVowelStrings(int n) {
                return (n + 4) * (n + 3) * (n + 2) * (n + 1) / 24;
            }
        };
     
     
     Time Complexity  : O(1) 
                        Since it only involves arithmetic operations
     Space Complexity : O(1)
                        Since no extra space is used
