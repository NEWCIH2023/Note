These are some resources I used throughout my long time studying for interviews. I also am in no way affiliated with any of the paid products and I don't represent Meta or Facebook at all. These are just things that I personally thought were helpful when studying for interviews. I also really appreciate your time and allowing me to share my story through your platform. Please stay in touch and would love to do more videos!

### Grokking

* https://www.educative.io/courses/grokking-the-system-design-interview - Really nice product that gives you a great overview.
* https://www.educative.io/courses/grokking-dynamic-programming-patterns-for-coding-interviews - Thought this was sneaky useful for working through recurrence relationships to optimized DP approaches.
* https://www.educative.io/courses/grokking-the-coding-interview - Also did this one but leetcode works just fine and is not necessary.


### Systems Design

* https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer - Is an awesome free resource if you want more practice or don’t want to pay for educative.
* https://www.youtube.com/c/TechDummiesNarendraL - Very in depth into building scalable systems.
* https://www.youtube.com/c/GauravSensei/ - Great content and he presents the information very well. Also good to build foundational knowledge.

### Algos and DS

* https://leetcode.com/ - Holy grail of interview prep. I personally purchased a premium subscription and used it to study for company specifics. Probably not necessary but I thought the cost was worth it.
* https://www.youtube.com/c/CodingDecoded - Best resource on youtube :). For real though, being able to visually see a solution helps so much and I would advise everyone to use this to see how a problem is solved in their head and then put it into code.
* https://www.youtube.com/c/AlgorithmsMadeEasy - Also does a great job of making visual representations of how to solve problems. I used them much more before Coding Decoded started making daily videos.
* https://www.youtube.com/user/tusharroy2525 - Great learning but sometimes doesn’t explain why or how he got to a specific solution. Overall though great content here and Tushar is a legend.
* https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZCFT11CWBi3MHNlGf019nw - Abdul barri. Great to help with foundational knowledge.
* https://www.youtube.com/c/Errichto - Really good competitive programmer who solves tougher problems. Might not be as applicable for interviews but great information.


### Mock Interviews

I honestly don’t really like these because a lot of the people don’t have a great background so you may just waste time listening to people talk about stuff they aren’t very knowledgeable on. I would find someone (or a group of people) who are at similar processes in their learning journey and do some mock interviews for practice. Here are some options though.

### Linkedin

If anyone has questions or wants to chat please reach out. I love talking about the process and it is something I have put countless hours into. If I can help be a resource I would love to give back to the community.
