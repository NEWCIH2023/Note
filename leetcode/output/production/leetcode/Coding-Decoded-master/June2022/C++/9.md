# Problem
 
## [167. Two Sum II - Input array is sorted](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum-ii-input-array-is-sorted/)


# Solution 
                         
## 1) Two Pointers - OPTIMAL APPROACH

      Since the array is sorted and there is an unique answer, we use 2 variables l, h pointing
      to first and last element of the aray.
      We increment and decrement l and h based on the current sum and return the indices.  
      
      
   ### Code : (.cpp)
    
          class Solution {
          public:
              vector<int> twoSum(vector<int>& v, int t) {
                  int i, n = v.size();
                  int l = 0, h = n-1;
                  while (l < h) {
                      if (v[l]+v[h] == t) break;
                      else if (v[l]+v[h] > t) h--;
                      else l++;
                  }
                  return {l+1, h+1}; 
              }
          };

 
      Time Complexity  : O(N) 
                         Since we traverse through each and every element in the array
      Space Complexity : O(1)
                         Since no auxillary space is used
