# Problem

## [3. Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-substring-without-repeating-characters/)


# Solution 
 
## 1) SLIDING WINDOW + HASH TABLE - OPTIMAL
 
        Since we need the longest substring without repeating characters, we need to keep track of 2 things.
            1. The frequencies of each character
            2. The count of distinct characters
            
        To do this, we make use of the sliding window technique.
        
        The first pointer 'j' stores the starting point of the window and the second window 'i' points to the ending point.
        When the frequency of any character is greater than 1, we stop the process and update the 'ans' with current length 'cnt'.
        Then we move the 'j' pointer forward until the frequency of s[i] character becomes 1.
        
        Finally we return the 'ans'.
        
       
   ### Code (.cpp)
   
              class Solution {
              public:
                  int lengthOfLongestSubstring(string s) {
                      int i, j = 0, n = s.size(), ans = 0, cnt = 0;
                      map<char,int> v;
                      for (i=0;i<n;i++) {
                          if (v[s[i]] == 0) {
                              v[s[i]] = 1;
                              cnt++;
                          }
                          else {
                              ans = max(ans,cnt);
                              while (v[s[i]] == 1) {
                                  v[s[j]] = 0;
                                  j++;
                                  cnt--;
                              }
                              cnt++;
                              v[s[i]] = 1;
                          }
                      }
                      ans = max(cnt,ans);
                      return ans;
                  }
              };
     
     
     Time Complexity  : O(N)
                        Since we linearly traverse the string once
     Space Complexity : O(N)
                        Since we use a hash map to store the frequencies of each character
