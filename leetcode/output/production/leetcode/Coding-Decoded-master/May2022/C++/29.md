   ### Code : (.cpp)
    
          class Solution {
              public:
                  int divide(int dividend, int divisor) {
                      if (dividend == INT_MIN && divisor == -1) {
                          return INT_MAX;
                      }
                      long dvd = labs(dividend), dvs = labs(divisor), ans = 0;
                      int sign = dividend > 0 ^ divisor > 0 ? -1 : 1;
                      while (dvd >= dvs) {
                          long temp = dvs, m = 1;
                          while (temp << 1 <= dvd) {
                              temp <<= 1;
                              m <<= 1;
                          }
                          dvd -= temp;
                          ans += m;
                      }
                      return sign * ans;
                  }
              };

 
      Time Complexity  : O((log(N))^2) 
                         Since the outer loop reduces n by at least half each iteration. So It has O(log N) iterations. The inner loop has at most log N iterations.
      Space Complexity : O(1)
                         Since no extra space is used.
