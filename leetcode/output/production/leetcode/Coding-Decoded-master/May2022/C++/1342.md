# Problem

## [1342. Number of Steps to Reduce a Number to Zero](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-steps-to-reduce-a-number-to-zero/)


# Solution 

## 1) Bit Manipulation - OPTIMAL

     The ans is 2*(no. of set bits) + Total no. of bits.
      
      
   ### Code : (.cpp)
    
            class Solution {
            public:
                int numberOfSteps (int n) {
                    return (n > 0) ? (int)log2(n) + __builtin_popcount(n) : 0;
                }
            };
            
 
      Time Complexity  : O(log(N)) 
                         Since we fidn total bits of the number.
      Space Complexity : O(1)
                         Since no extra space is used.
