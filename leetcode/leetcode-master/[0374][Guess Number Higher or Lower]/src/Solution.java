     * We are playing the Guess Game. The game is as follows:
     *
     * I pick a number from 1 to n. You have to guess which number I picked.
     *
     * Every time you guess wrong, I'll tell you whether the number is higher or lower.
     *
     * You call a pre-defined API guess(int num) which returns 3 possible results (-1, 1, or 0):
     *
     * -1 : My number is lower
     *  1 : My number is higher
     *  0 : Congrats! You got it!
     * Example :
     *
     * Input: n = 10, pick = 6
     * Output: 6
     * </pre>
     *
     * @param n
     * @return
